# AI-Powered-Climate-Awareness-Action-Assistant

### Project Overview

This project presents a prompt-based conversational AI assistant designed to support climate awareness and sustainable decision-making. The solution helps users understand climate change issues, sustainability practices, and environmentally responsible actions through simple, guided conversations.

The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a conceptual Agentic AI workflow to interpret user queries, guide decision paths, and provide responsible, transparent responses related to climate and sustainability.

### Problem Statement

Lack of accessible and easy-to-understand climate information prevents individuals and communities from making informed, sustainable decisions. Existing resources are often fragmented, technical, or difficult for non-expert users to navigate.

This project aims to bridge this gap by providing a conversational AI interface that delivers reliable climate-related guidance in a user-friendly and responsible manner.

### 💡 Solution Description

-The proposed solution is a conversational AI assistant that:

-Interacts with users using natural language

-Provides climate awareness insights

-Guides users toward sustainable choices

-Encourages responsible environmental behavior

The system follows an Agentic AI workflow where the AI understands intent, retrieves relevant climate knowledge (conceptually via RAG), and generates contextual responses aligned with Responsible AI principles.
